### About the project

- **Objective**: This dashboard provides insights into the yearly cumulative number of accidents in the UK, with filters for year and accident severity. Users can compare accident values between years, view casualty data by vehicle and road category, and examine how weather and road conditions relate to accident severity.
- **Approach**: Though powerful tools like Python (Pandas) and SQL were available, Excel was intentionally used for data cleaning to strengthen foundational skills in spreadsheet manipulation.
- **Data Fields**: Out of 27 fields in the original dataset, 14 were utilized for this analysis.
- **Key Visuals**: The dashboard highlights a comparative view of accidents of fatal severity between 2021 and 2022, along with other metrics.
